\title{
Useful functions for the multivariate analysis of logbooks data for identifying metiers.
}

\description{
This function contains several functions needed for the multivariate analysis of logbooks data for identifying metiers.

\item{transformation_proportion}{Transform quantities to percentage values (between 0 and 100) of each species in the logevent total catch.
}

\item{table_variables}{Transpose the dataset (change variables into individuals)
}

\item{scree}{Implementation of "scree-test"
}

\item{select_species}{Remove the cluster with the smallest mean of capture
}

\item{building_tab_pca}{Build the table with the main species
}

\item{test.values}{Compute the test-value for each species by cluster
}

\item{targetspecies}{Determine the species with a test-value > 1.96 by cluster
}

\item{withinVar}{Calculate the cluster's within-variance
}

}
