\title{
Finding metiers for a new reduced EFLALO dataset from a reduced EFLALO dataset for which the metiers are known.
}
\description{
This function permits to determine the metiers of new logevents belonging to a new reduced EFLALO dataset, from a reduced EFLALO dataset for which the
metiers are known. For example, this function permits to determine the metiers of logevents realized in 2008, basing on metiers of logevents realized
in 2007. It works with a discriminante analysis ran with the function fda. In the first time, the function fda calibrates a model basing on the dataset 
for which the metiers are known. In the second time, the function predict is used to predict the metiers of new logevents, thanks to the previous
model.

\usage{
predictMetier(learningData,clustersAffectation,newData)
}

\arguments{
  \item{learningData}{A numerical matrix with logevents as lines and species as columns, with percentage values (between 0 and 100) of each species 
  in the logevent catches. Logevent ID (LE_ID) should be as row names. Typically, this table will be produced from a eflalo dataset at the step 1 of 
  the metier analysis, using the function extractTableMainSpecies()
}
  \item{clustersAffectation}{An integer vector of length n, the number of logevents in learningData, giving for each
  logevent the number of the cluster to which it belongs. This vector will be produced at the step 3 of the metier analysis,
  using the function getMetierClusters(). 
}
  \item{newData}{A numerical matrix with logevents as lines and species as columns, with raw values of each species in the logevent catches. 
  Logevent ID (LE_ID) should be as row names. 
}
}

\details{
}

\value{
A data frame giving the logevent ID (LE_ID) (first column) and the number of the cluster to which it belongs (second column), for all logevents
in newData. The cluster number "0" corresponds to the unknown metier.
