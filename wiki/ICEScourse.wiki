  # [http://code.google.com/p/vmstools/wiki/Lecture1 A brief introduction to the use of R, functions, scripting and installing libraries.]
  # [http://code.google.com/p/vmstools/wiki/Lecture2 VMS data – advantages, limitations, data confidentiality issues.]
  # EU logbook data – advantages, limitations, data confidentiality issues.
  # EU logbook data metier analyses based on species composition of landings.
  # Combining VMS and logbook data –why it is important?
  # Standardising VMS and logbook analyses for populating pan European databases, e.g FishFrame.
  # Indicators – what do they tell us?
  # Introduction to spatial statistics – shapefiles, points, lines, polygons, map projections, and data-storage.
  # Exploring the connection between fishing effort and other possibly explanatory variables (e.g. depth, primary production, temperature, wind speed).
