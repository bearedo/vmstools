= Practical 4: How to link VMS and logbook data to 'spatial' grids

== Introduction ==
In general, logbook data is recorded a the ICES rectangle level. VMS data however, is not associated with any spatial scale (other than taking account of the uncertainty in the data itself which may be a limiting factor). In many instances however, the output of any analyses is required to be delivered at some spatial scale. If that spatial scale is ICES rectangle for logbook data, you're lucky, but most often it requires a bit more work. 

Here we will provide some tools to help you out with these exercise.

== Converting between spatial notations ==
What if you are required to report VMS data analyses on the ICES rectangle. Will you go through some complicated procedure to find the closest ICES rectangle to your data, or just use the embedded functionality in VMStools! Let's see how that would work.
<code>
#Start fresh!
>rm(list=ls())

#load the data
>data(tacsat); data(eflalo)

>tacsat$LE_RECT <- ICESrectangle(tacsat)
#That was easy, can we also convert back?
>pos <- ICESrectangle2LonLat(tacsat$LE_RECT,midpoint=T)
>tacsatCompare <- cbind(tacsat,pos)
>head(tacsatCompare)
