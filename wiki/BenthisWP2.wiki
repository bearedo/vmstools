Objectives
* To map habitat types and sea bed impact from fishing activities in EU waters to identify where fisheries
potentially compromises seafloor integrity conflicts of ecosystem services
* to develop and implement new methodology, combining VMS, logbook and industry data, to assess
actual seabed impact from large scale fishing activities on an appropriate spatial and temporal scale

Please find below an example workflow to treat VMS and Logbook in a systematic manner to create swept area maps.


  * Installing & loading libraries
  The VMStools software available [http://code.google.com/p/vmstools/downloads/ here]
  The procedure for installing the VMStools library under R is described [http://code.google.com/p/vmstools/w/edit/Introduction here]
  
<code>  

rm(list=ls())
library(vmstools)
library(maps)
library(mapdata)
memory.size(4000)

<\code>  
  


  * setting directories
 <code>  

user <- "FRANCOIS"
if(user == "FRANCOIS"){
  codePath  <- ""
  dataPath  <- "C:/merging/EflaloAndTacsat/"
  pricePath <- ""
  outPath   <- "C:/merging/BENTHIS/outputs/"
  polPath   <- "C:/merging/BalanceMaps"
} else {
    codePath  <- "N:/Projecten/Value maps North Sea/8 Code/R/"
    dataPath  <- "R:/tacsatEflalo/"
    pricePath <- "N:/Projecten/Value maps North Sea/8 Code/Data/"
    outPath   <- "N:/Projecten/Value maps North Sea/8 Code/Results/"
    polPath   <- "D:/Repository/VMStools/polygons/"
  }

  outPath   <- sub("N:/","/media/n/",outPath)
  polPath   <- sub("N:/","/media/n/",polPath)

  * loading VMS and Logbook data
  * turning VMS and Logbook data into tacsat and eflalo
  * cleaning tacsat
  * cleaning eflalo
  * merge eflalo and tacsat
  * link gear characteristics to tacsat 
    * read in table (from interviews / experimental studies)
    * make use of functional relationship between vessel HP or length to gear size
  * define activity
    * speed profiles
    * need for Fock??
  * interpolate data
    * interpolateTacsat (active towed gear)
    * buffer area (passive gear)
  * interpolation conversion into tacsat 
    * swept area calculation per ping
  * labeling hauls
  * severity of activity
    * read in table (from interviews / experimental studies)
  * link habitat map to vms
    * shapefile 
    * raster
  * define grid
    * mid-point polygon distance distribution
    * random process of fishing activity
  * maps + sum / average different grids

  * non-vms maps
  * testing
