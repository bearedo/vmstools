=Benthis WP2 workflow example=

Please find below an example workflow to treat VMS and Logbook in a systematic manner to create swept area maps.


  * Installing & loading libraries
  * setting directories
  * loading VMS and Logbook data
  * turning VMS and Logbook data into tacsat and eflalo
  * cleaning tacsat
  * cleaning eflalo
  * merge eflalo and tacsat
  * link gear characteristics to tacsat 
    * read in table (from interviews / experimental studies)
  * define activity
    * speed profiles
    * need for Fock??
  * interpolate data
    * interpolateTacsat (active towed gear)
    * buffer area (passive gear)
  * interpolation conversion into tacsat 
    * swept area calculation per ping
  * labeling hauls
  * severity of activity
    * read in table (from interviews / experimental studies)
  * link habitat map to vms
    * shapefile 
    * raster
  * define grid
    * mid-point polygon distance distribution
    * random process of fishing activity
  * maps + sum / average different grids

  * non-vms maps
