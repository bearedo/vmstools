#Practical 1: Getting the VMS and logbook data into R

= Introduction =
Welcome to the first practical of the ICES VMStools course. Within the series of practicals you will learn how to deal with VMS and logbook data to produce a variety of end results ranging from the calculation of indicators of seabed disturbance to linking your data with for example temperature datasets. 

The practicals you will work on will consist of some guidance text, some code that can be copied directly into R and some examples to test your skills. In all instances, the R code necessary to do the job will be included and hence allows you, after the course, to immediately get started with your own data! 

=== It is recommended to carefully read through the text that goes with each of the practicals ===

= Getting started =
Before doing anything, make sure you have installed a good editor where you can 'store' your code. Examples are Tinn-R or R-studio. However, programs as notepad work as well (but do not have function and bracket color recognition). It is also important that you have a good R version running. Make sure that it is R2.14.x or higher! (How can I check...)
<code>R.Version()$version.string</code>
